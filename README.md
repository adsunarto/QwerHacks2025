EcoTogether connects students for ecofriendly carpooling, with options for LGBTQ+ friendly, pet-friendly, and accessibility options. Drive green, reduce emissions, and build a more inclusive community

---
## Inspiration
EcoTogether was inspired by the need for sustainable transportation options that also prioritize inclusivity. As students often face challenges with carpooling—whether it’s finding accessible rides, LGBTQ+ friendly environments, or ensuring their pets are welcome—we wanted to create a platform that addresses these issues while promoting environmental consciousness.

## What it does
EcoTogether connects students for eco-friendly carpooling with customizable preferences such as LGBTQ+ friendly, pet-friendly, and accessibility features. It helps reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions while creating a more inclusive, supportive carpooling experience.

## How we built it
We built EcoTogether using a combination of Google Maps API for route mapping, Node.js for backend functionality, MongoDB for data storage, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end user interface. The app allows users to create profiles, specify carpooling preferences, and easily connect with others based on shared needs and routes.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was integrating Google Maps to accurately display potential carpool routes and match students based on location. Additionally, we had to ensure the inclusivity preferences were flexible enough to accommodate various needs without complicating the user interface. Balancing performance and design was tricky but rewarding.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of how the app balances both functionality and inclusivity. The ability for users to select various preferences (LGBTQ+ friendly, pet-friendly, accessibility) adds a unique layer of personalization that most carpool apps don’t offer. Additionally, the smooth integration of Google Maps for route planning and sharing enhances the user experience.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about developing a full-stack application, especially integrating APIs like Google Maps. We also gained a deeper understanding of the importance of designing with inclusivity in mind—making sure the app feels welcoming to all users, regardless of their preferences or needs. Additionally, we refined our skills in MongoDB for user data management.

## What's next for EcoTogether
Next, we plan to add more features like ride scheduling, carpooling rewards (like credits for reducing carbon footprint), and enhanced security features for user verification. We’d also like to expand to other campuses and explore partnerships with local sustainability initiatives to further encourage eco-friendly travel.
